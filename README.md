# killer-bot
Discord Bot for serving up assassination contracts from a CSV file. You can probably edit it to serve up just about any kind of responses based on CSV input.... like a lunch bot or something. Use your imagination and be creative. 

Put killer-bot.py, .env, and targets.csv (mot included) in a folder and go nuts.

Requires:
pip install discord.py
pip install python-dotenv

I have also included a sample systemd service file that I used to run the script automatically on reboot. Just edit the paths, user, and enable/start the service.

I accept no liability for anything that happens if you use this code. I make no warranties or guarantees whatsoever. Use at your own risk, etc.
